**Cluster-Based Recommendation System for Airbnb Listings**

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a
more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. In this project, we will leverage data
from Airbnb listings in New York City. The data comprises information on listings such as
neighborhood, service fee, minimum nights, number of reviews, last review date, reviews per
month - all which contribute to the popularity of an Airbnb.

Using advanced data mining techniques, we can gain a better understanding from historical data
of Airbnb listings in the city of New York. From our analysis, we will be able to provide
recommendations to hosts such as the optimal price range for new listings and trending
keywords that attract more customers, resulting in improved ratings.

By utilizing data mining techniques such as clustering and prediction algorithms, we can
categorize the listings based on the attributes they share, in turn helping us predict which listings
would be more successful and use that to make recommendations for existing listings.
